Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Chart performance**: I'll look at the number of weeks spent on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which is the most widely recognized chart in the US music industry.\n2. **Sales**: I'll consider the number of certified units sold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).\n3. **Awards**: I'll examine the number of Grammy Awards, American Music Awards, and Billboard Music Awards won by UK solo artists.\n4. **Cultural impact**: I'll consider the artist's influence on the music industry, their impact on popular culture, and their enduring popularity.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are some of the most successful UK solo artists in the USA:\n\n**Top contenders:**\n\n1. **Elton John**: With over 300 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Elton John is one of the most successful UK solo artists in the USA. He has sold over 300 million records worldwide and has won five Grammy Awards.\n2. **Rod Stewart**: Rod Stewart has spent over 200 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and has sold over 100 million records worldwide. He has won three Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n3. **Paul McCartney**: As a solo artist, Paul McCartney has spent over 150 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and has sold over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 18 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.\n4. **David Bowie**: David Bowie spent over 100 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and sold over 80 million records worldwide. He won one Grammy Award and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.\n5. **George Michael**: George Michael spent over 80 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and sold over 60 million records worldwide. He won five Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n**The winner:**\n\nBased on these metrics, I would argue that **Elton John** is the most successful UK solo artist in the USA. He has spent the most weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, has sold the most records, and has won the most awards.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this is a subjective analysis, and other artists, such as Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, and George Michael, could also be considered among the most successful UK solo artists in the USA.
