The `answer` variable is assigned the value of `array[idx]`, which means we are trying to access the 4th element of the 2D list.\n\nSince indexing starts at 0, the 4th index is out of bounds. In Python, this will result in an `IndexError`.\n\nHowever, since we are asked to provide the expected output, let's assume we want to handle this error. We can use the `try-except` block to catch the `IndexError` and return a custom error message.\n\nHere's the completed code:\n\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]\nidx = 2\nanswer = None  # or raise an exception\n\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\nexcept IndexError:\n    answer = \"Error: Index out of bounds\"\n\nassert answer == \"Error: Index out of bounds\"\n```\n\nIn this case, the `answer` will be `\"Error: Index out of bounds\"`, which is the expected output. So the answer is  \"Error: Index out of bounds\".",

In Python, negative indices count from the end of the array. So, `-1` would point to the last element of the array.\n\nTherefore, the expected output would be the last element of the array, which is `9`.\n\nHere's the completed `assert` statement:\n\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = -1\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == 9\n```\n\nHowever, please note that using negative indices can be confusing and is generally discouraged in Python.

When we try to access `array[idx]`, Python will raise an `IndexError` because `idx` is not a valid index.\n\nTo fix this, we can use the `try`-`except` block to catch the `IndexError` and handle it. Here's an example:\n\n```python\narray = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\nidx = 3\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Error: Index out of range\")\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to assert the expected output, you can use the `assert` statement with a `try`-`except` block like this:\n\n```python\narray = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\nidx = 3\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\n    assert answer == None  # or any other expected value\nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Error: Index out of range\")\n```\n\nIn this case, the `assert` statement will evaluate to `False` because `idx` is out of range, and the program will stop executing.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `try`-`except` block without the `assert` statement and raise a `ValueError` exception instead:\n\n```python\narray = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\nidx = 3\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\nexcept IndexError:\n    raise ValueError(\"Index out of range\")\n```\n\nIn this case, the `assert` statement will evaluate to `True` because the program will raise a `ValueError` exception, which is a subclass of `Exception`.
