We define the array `array` with the given values.\n2. We set the index `idx` to 2.\n3. We use the `array[idx]` expression to get the value at index 2 in the array.\n4. We assign the result to the variable `answer`.\n5. We print the value of `answer`.\n6. We use an `assert` statement to check if the value of `answer` is equal to 3.\n7. If the value of `answer` is not equal to 3, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` with a message that includes the expected value and the actual value. So the answer is 3, not 5.",

Since `idx` is 3, we can access the element at index 3 in the list.\n\nHere's the completed code:\n\n```python\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nidx = 3\nanswer = array[idx]\nprint(answer)  # Output: 4\nassert answer == 4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We define the list `array` with the given elements.\n2. We define the index `idx` as 3.\n3. We access the element at index `idx` in the list using `array[idx]`.\n4. We assign the result to the variable `answer`.\n5. We print the value of `answer`.\n6. We use the `assert` statement to check if the value of `answer` is equal to the expected output, which is 4. So the answer is 4.",
