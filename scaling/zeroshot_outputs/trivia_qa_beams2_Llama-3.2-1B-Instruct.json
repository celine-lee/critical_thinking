He has had numerous chart-topping hits like \"Rocket Man,\" \"Crocodile Rock,\" and \"Candle in the Wind 1997.\"\n2. **Paul McCartney**: As a member of The Beatles, Paul McCartney has sold over 100 million records in the USA, and as a solo artist, he has had numerous chart-topping hits like \"Yesterday,\" \"Hey Jude,\" and \"Let It Be.\"\n3. **Elton John** (again!): As mentioned earlier, Elton John has sold over 300 million records in the USA, making him one of the best-selling solo artists of all time.\n4. **Stevie Wonder**: With over 100 million records sold in the USA, Stevie Wonder is one of the most successful R&B artists of all time.

He has had an incredibly successful career spanning over five decades, with numerous chart-topping hits, sold-out tours, and numerous awards, including multiple Grammy Awards. So the answer is 1.
