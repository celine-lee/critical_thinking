However, it's essential to note that camel meat is not commonly consumed in many parts of the world, and its availability and safety can vary greatly depending on the region and country.\n\nCamel meat is a traditional food in some Middle Eastern and North African countries, particularly in countries like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Egypt. In these regions, camel meat is often consumed in traditional dishes, such as kebabs, stews, and soups.\n\nHowever, in many other parts of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Australia, camel meat is not commonly consumed due to concerns about its safety and potential allergens.\n\nIf you have celiac disease, it's crucial to take precautions when consuming camel meat to avoid cross-contamination with gluten, which is present in some camel products, such as:\n\n1. **Meat and bone meal**: Camel meat can be processed into meat and bone meal, which may contain gluten.\n2. **By-products**: Camel meat may be processed into by-products, such as gelatin, collagen, or other animal tissues, which can also contain gluten.\n3. **Cross-contamination**: Camel meat may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products, such as bread, pasta, or baked goods.\n\nTo safely consume camel meat, you can take the following precautions:\n\n1. **Choose camel meat from reputable sources**: Opt for camel meat from countries or regions where it is commonly consumed and has a good reputation for being gluten-free.\n2. **Check the labeling**: Look for camel meat products that are labeled as \"gluten-free\" or \"celiac-friendly.\"\n3. **Cooking and preparation**: Cook camel meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to kill any potential bacteria.\n4. **Avoid cross-contamination**: Be mindful of cross-contamination with gluten-containing products or surfaces when preparing and storing camel meat.\n\nIt's also essential to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized advice on managing celiac disease and consuming camel meat safely.

It was powered by two Rolls-Royce Olympus 593 engines, which produced a combined 100,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more modern aircraft, the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft is likely to be the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a supersonic reconnaissance plane that was in service from 1964 to 1998. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney YJ79 engines, which produced a combined 32,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nBut if you're looking for a commercial airliner, the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft is likely to be the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is a wide-body, twin-engine jet that was introduced in 2011. It has a maximum cruise speed of over Mach 0.85 (around 640 mph or 1,030 km/h).\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n* Concorde: Olympus 593 engines, 100,000 pounds of thrust\n* SR-71 Blackbird: Pratt & Whitney YJ79 engines, 32,000 pounds of thrust\n* Boeing 787 Dreamliner: twin-engine, 100,000 pounds of thrust So the answer is 100,000 pounds of thrust.",

The first recorded discovery of superconductivity was made by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1911, and it was later confirmed by other scientists, including James Clerk Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz.\n\nHowever, the United States did play a significant role in the development of superconductivity research, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. The first practical superconducting materials were developed in the United States in the 1950s, and the first commercial superconducting applications were made in the 1960s.\n\nOne notable example is the development of the first practical superconducting magnet, which was built in the United States in the 1950s by physicist Robert C. Richardson. The magnet was used in the first commercial superconducting power transmission lines, which were built in the United States in the 1960s.\n\nSo, to answer your question, there was no president of the United States who discovered superconductivity.

However, the father of computer science as a distinct field is often considered to be Alan Turing, a British mathematician, computer scientist, and logician who is widely regarded as the father of computer science.\n\nTuring's work on the theoretical foundations of computation, the development of the theoretical model of the universal Turing machine, and his proposal for the concept of the \"computer\" as a machine that can perform calculations automatically, laid the foundation for the field of computer science.\n\nOther notable figures who contributed to the development of computer science include Ada Lovelace, who is often considered the first computer programmer, and Konrad Zuse, who developed the first fully automatic digital computer, the Z3.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose one person who is often referred to as the \"father of computer science,\" I would say it is Alan Turing. So the answer is  Alan Turing.",
