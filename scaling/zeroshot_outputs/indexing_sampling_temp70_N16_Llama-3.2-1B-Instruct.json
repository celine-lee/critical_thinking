In Python, the list indices start at 0, so `-3` is equivalent to `-4`. \n\n- We then use the `print(answer)` statement to verify that the value of `answer` is indeed `100000`. \n\n- Finally, we use the `assert` statement to check if the value of `answer` matches the expected output.

The array has 10 elements, and indices start from 0, so the last valid index is 9.\n\nSince `idx` is 2, which is less than the length of the array (10), we know that there is no element at index 2.\n\nTo access the element at index 2, we need to use Python's slice notation, which is `array[idx:idx+1]`.\n\nSo, the correct code should be:\n```python\narray = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]\nidx = 2\nanswer = array[idx:idx+1]\nassert answer == [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]\n```\nThis code will output `[4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]`, which is the expected result.

We have an array `array` with dimensions 3x3, and an index `idx` of 2.\n2. To find the value at index 2, we need to access the row at index 2 (since Python uses 0-based indexing).\n3. The row at index 2 is `[4, 5, 6]`.\n4. The value at index 2 in the row `[4, 5, 6]` is 5.\n\nTherefore, the expected output for the assert statement is `5`. \n\nSo, the completed assert statement would be:\n```\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = 2\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == 5\n```\n\nIn Python, the `array[idx]` would be evaluated as follows:\n\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = 2\nanswer = array[2]\nprint(answer)  # Output: [5, 5, 6]\n``` So the answer is 5. \n",
