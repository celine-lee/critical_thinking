                "model_generation": "The discovery of superconductivity is attributed to several scientists, and it's difficult to pinpoint a single president. However, I can provide you with some key milestones in the history of superconductivity.\n\nThe discovery of superconductivity is often credited to:\n\n1. **Heike Kamerlingh Onnes** (Netherlands): In 1911, Onnes, a Dutch physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1913 for his work on superconductivity. He discovered that certain materials, such as mercury and lead, could conduct electricity with zero resistance when cooled to extremely low temperatures.\n2. **Albert Einstein** (Switzerland): Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect in 1905 and 1915 laid the foundation for the understanding of superconductivity. He proposed the concept of the \"quantum vacuum,\" which led to the development of superconducting materials.\n3. **Robert Millikan** (USA): In 1909, Millikan, an American physicist, measured the charge of an electron, which led to a deeper understanding of the behavior of electrons and the development of superconducting materials.\n4. **Charles Townes** (USA): Townes, an American physicist, made significant contributions to the understanding of superconductivity in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly in the development of superconducting materials and their applications.\n\nAs for a specific president, it's worth noting that the discovery of superconductivity was a gradual process that involved the contributions of many scientists over several decades.\n\nSo, to answer your question, it's difficult to identify a single president who was directly responsible for the discovery of superconductivity. However, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, Albert Einstein, Robert Millikan, and Charles Townes were all key figures in the history of superconductivity. So the answer is 1911, when Onnes discovered superconductivity.",
