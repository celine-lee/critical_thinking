The resulting list is: `[\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"python\"]`.\n3. The index `idx` is set to `2`.\n4. We want to access the element at index `idx` in the list.\n5. In Python, indexing starts at 0, so the element at index `2` is the third element in the list.\n6. The third element in the list is `\"this\"`.\n7. Therefore, the expected output is `\"this\"`.\n\nSo, the completed `assert` statement would be:\n```\nassert answer == \"this\"\n``` So the answer is  \"this\". The final answer is $\\boxed{this}$. I hope it is correct.",
