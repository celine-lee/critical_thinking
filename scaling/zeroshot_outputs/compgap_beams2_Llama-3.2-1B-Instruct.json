Camel meat is typically fed a diet of hay, grains, and other plant-based foods, which do not contain gluten.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some camel meat products may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing grains, which could potentially lead to cross-contamination. Additionally, some camel meat products may be labeled as \"gluten-free\" or \"celiac-friendly,\" but this does not necessarily mean that the product is safe for individuals with celiac disease.\n\nIf you have celiac disease, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized advice on what foods are safe for you to eat.

Camel meat, on the other hand, is a type of meat that comes from camels, which are domesticated animals that are not typically considered a food source for humans.\n\nIn general, people with celiac disease cannot eat camel meat because of the presence of gluten in the camel's diet. Camel meat is typically fed a diet of hay, grains, and other plant-based foods, which do not contain gluten.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some camel meat products may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing grains, which could potentially lead to cross-contamination. Additionally, some camel meat products may be labeled as \"gluten-free\" or \"celiac-friendly,\" but this does not necessarily mean that the product is safe for individuals with celiac disease.\n\nIf you have celiac disease, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized advice on what foods are safe to eat. So the answer is 0, people with celiac disease cannot eat camel meat.",
