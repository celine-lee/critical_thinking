In Python, negative indices start from -1, not 0. So, `-1` is equivalent to `-2`.\n\nTherefore, `array[idx]` will raise an `IndexError` because `-2` is not a valid index for a 2D list.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the index is within the valid range. We can do this by checking if the index is within the bounds of the array before trying to access it.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = -1\nif -1 < 0:  # Check if idx is within the bounds of the array\n    answer = array[-1]  # Access the last element of the array\nelse:\n    answer = None  # or some other default value\nassert answer == 3\n```\nAlternatively, we can use the `try-except` block to handle the `IndexError` exception:\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = -1\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\nexcept IndexError:\n    answer = None  # or some other default value\nassert answer == 3\n``` So the answer is 3.",

In Python, negative indices start from -1, not 0. So, `-1` is equivalent to `-2`.\n\nTherefore, `array[idx]` will raise an `IndexError` because `-2` is not a valid index for a 2D list.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the index is within the valid range. We can do this by checking if the index is within the bounds of the array before trying to access it.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = -1\nif -1 < 0:  # Check if idx is within the bounds of the array\n    answer = array[-1]  # Access the last element of the array\nelse:\n    answer = None  # or some other default value\nassert answer == 3\n```\nAlternatively, we can use the `try-except` block to handle the `IndexError` exception:\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = -1\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\nexcept IndexError:\n    answer = None  # or some other default value\nassert answer == 3\n``` So the answer is 3.",

The assertion fails because `3` is not equal to `array[2]`.\n\nTo fix this, you should change the line `answer = array[idx]` to `answer = array[idx - 1]`, since `idx` is `2`, which is one less than the length of the list.
