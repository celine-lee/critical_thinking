Therefore, the `IndexError` will be raised.\n\nHere's how you can complete the assert statement:\n\n```python\narray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nidx = -1\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\nexcept IndexError:\n    answer = \"IndexError: list index out of range\"\nassert answer == \"IndexError: list index out of range\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `try-except` block to catch the `IndexError` and assign the expected error message to the `answer` variable:\n\n```python\narray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nidx = -1\ntry:\n    answer = array[idx]\nexcept IndexError:\n    answer = \"IndexError: list index out of range\"\nassert answer == \"IndexError: list index out of range\"\n``` So the answer is  \"IndexError: list index out of range\".",

In this case, `idx` is 2.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. The array is `[True, False, True, False]`.\n2. We need to find the value at index 2.\n3. In Python, indexing starts at 0, so the values are:\n   - Index 0: `True`\n   - Index 1: `False`\n   - Index 2: `True`\n   - Index 3: `False`\n4. Therefore, the value at index 2 is `True`.\n\nSo, the completed assert statement should be:\n\n```python\narray = [True, False, True, False]\nidx = 2\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == True\n``` So the answer is  True.",

The variable `idx` is assigned the value `-2`.\n3. The code attempts to access the element at index `-2` in the `array` using `answer = array[idx]`.\n\nHowever, in Python, negative indices are allowed, and they count from the end of the list. So, `-2` would point to the second-to-last element in the list.\n\nTherefore, the correct index for `-2` would be `4`, since indexing starts at `0`.\n\nSo, the expected output should be `11`.\n\nHere's the completed assert statement:\n\n```python\narray = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]\nidx = -2\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == 11\n``` So the answer is 11.",

The `split()` method splits the string into a list of words, using spaces as the delimiter.\n3. The resulting list is: `array = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'python']`\n4. We want to find the index of the word \"python\" in the list.\n5. Since the list is 0-indexed, the index of the word \"python\" is 4.\n\nSo, the completed assert statement would be:\n\n```python\narray = \"hello world this is python\".split()\nidx = 3\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == \"python\"\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, the assert statement will pass because the value of `answer` is indeed \"python\". So the answer is 4.",
