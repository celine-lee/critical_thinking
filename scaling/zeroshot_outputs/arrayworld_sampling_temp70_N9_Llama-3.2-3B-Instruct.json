We want to find the last index of the array, which is `len(array) - 1`. Since array indices start at 0, the last index is `2`.\n3. `idx` is set to the last index of the array, which is `2`.\n4. Now, we need to access the element at index `idx` in the `array`.\n5. Since `idx` is `2`, we need to access the third row of the array (remember that indexing starts at 0).\n6. The third row is `[6, 7, 8]`, so `answer` will be this row.\n\nSo, the completed assert statement should be:\n```\narray = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]\nidx = len(array) - 1\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == [6, 7, 8]\n```\nThis will pass because `array[2]` indeed equals `[6, 7, 8]`. So the answer is  [6, 7, 8].",

To do this, we can use the `max` function to get the maximum index that is not negative, which is `max(0, len(array) - 3)`. This will give us `max(0, -3) = 0`.\n6. So, `idx` is now `0`.\n7.
