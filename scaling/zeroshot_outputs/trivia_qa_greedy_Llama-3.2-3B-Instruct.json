According to the poem, the Snark is a shape-shifter that can change its form to evade its pursuers.\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nThe Snark ultimately turns into a Boojum, which is a type of cactus. Yes, you read that right - a cactus! The poem states: \"The Boojum is what a Snark had been, / And a very good thing for the Snark to be.\" (lines 34-35)\n\nThe Boojum is a clever and humorous twist, as it's a prickly and unlikely transformation for a creature that was previously thought to be a majestic and elusive beast.

He was also associated with thunder and was said to be the one who forged the Cyclopes' famous club, which was used to help them in their battles.\n3. **Steropes**: Steropes was the most skilled of the three brothers and was said to be the father of Alcyoneus and the Cyclopes' famous son, Polyphemus. He was also known for his exceptional craftsmanship and was said to have forged the Cyclopes' famous club, which was used to help them in their battles.\n\nAll three brothers were known for their incredible strength and were often called upon by the gods to help them in times of need.

The group was active from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, and its activities were characterized by guerrilla warfare, assassinations, bombings, and other forms of violence against the Peruvian government, civilians, and rival groups.\n\nThe Shining Path's stronghold was in the Apur\u00edmac, Ene, and Mantaro River Valley (VRAEM), a region in central Peru. This area is a remote and mountainous region, making it difficult for government forces to access and control.\n\nThe group's leader, Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, was captured in 1992, which led to a decline in the group's activities. However, remnants of the Shining Path continue to operate in some parts of Peru, although their influence and activity have significantly decreased since the 1990s.

Here's why:\n\n* **Chart performance:** Elton John has had an impressive 58 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with 27 top 10 hits, including 4 number one singles.\n* **Sales:** Elton John has sold over 300 million records worldwide, with over 100 million of those sales coming from the US.

According to the show's backstory, \"Kemo Sabe\" is a Apache word that means \"friend\" or \"comrade.\" It is a term of endearment used by the Lone Ranger to address his trusty sidekick, Tonto, a Native American who is a member of the Apache tribe.\n\nIn the show, the Lone Ranger would often say \"Hi-yo, Silver! Away!\" and \"Kemo Sabe!\" to Tonto, which roughly translates to \"Hello, friend!\" or \"Let's go, friend!\" The term has since become iconic and is still widely recognized today as a symbol of the Lone Ranger's friendship with Tonto.

The show was based on a children's novel of the same name by Walt Morey.\n\nThe series followed the adventures of a 17-year-old boy named Mark Wedloe, who befriends a giant black bear cub that he names Gentle Ben. The bear, Gentle Ben, was a massive grizzly bear that Mark had rescued from a hunter's trap. As the series progressed, Mark and Gentle Ben became inseparable friends, going on many exciting adventures together.\n\nThe show was known for its mix of action, adventure, and heartwarming moments, and it was a favorite among both children and adults. The series starred Clint Howard as Mark Wedloe and the bear, Gentle Ben, was played by a real bear, but also by a trained bear actor named Bruno.\n\nGentle Ben was a beloved character in the 1960s, and the show remains a nostalgic favorite among many who grew up watching it. So the answer is  Mark Wedloe and his giant bear friend, Gentle Ben!",
