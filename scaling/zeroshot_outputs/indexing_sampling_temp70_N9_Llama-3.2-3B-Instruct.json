The string \"hello world this is python\" is split into a list `array` using the `split()` method. This will result in `array = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"python\"]`.\n\n2. Since indexing in Python starts at 0, we need to find the index of the string \"python\" in the list `array`. \n\n3. The index of \"python\" in the list `array` is 4 (index 3 is the last element \"is\").\n\nSo, the expected output is `array[3]`.\n\nThe completed `assert` statement would be:\n```\narray = \"hello world this is python\".split()\nidx = 2\nanswer = array[3]\nassert answer == \"python\"\n``` So the answer is 3.
