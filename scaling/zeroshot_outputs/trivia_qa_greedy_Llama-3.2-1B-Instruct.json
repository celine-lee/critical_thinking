The group was active from the 1970s to the 1990s and was known for its Marxist-Leninist ideology and its use of violence against the Peruvian government and its opponents.\n\nThe Shining Path's stronghold was in the Andean region of Peru, particularly in the following areas:\n\n1. The Sacred Valley of the Incas: This region, which includes the cities of Cusco, Pisac, and Ollantaytambo, was a key stronghold of the Shining Path.\n2. The Andean highlands: The group operated in the provinces of Cusco, Apur\u00edmac, and Puno, where they targeted government forces, police, and civilians.\n3. The Amazon rainforest: The Shining Path also had a presence in the Amazon rainforest, where they conducted guerrilla warfare against the Peruvian military and local communities.\n\nThe Shining Path's activities were marked by a brutal and violent campaign against civilians, including massacres, kidnappings, and forced disappearances. The group's use of violence was often targeted at the Peruvian government and its allies, as well as at perceived enemies of the revolution, including members of the Catholic Church and local communities.\n\nThe Shining Path's activities were eventually suppressed by the Peruvian military in the 1990s, and the group's leaders were arrested and executed. However, the legacy of the Shining Path continues to be felt in Peru, and the country remains a source of concern for human rights groups and international organizations. So the answer is  Peru.",
