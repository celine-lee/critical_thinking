We have an array `array` with three elements: `apple`, `banana`, and `cherry`.\n2. We have an index `idx` set to `-1`, which is an invalid index for the array.\n3. We want to access the element at the index `-1`.\n\nIn Python, the index `-1` is an invalid index because array indices start at `0`. So, when `idx` is `-1`, the expression `array[idx]` will raise an `IndexError` because Python doesn't know what to do with `-1`.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the index is within the valid range of the array. We can do this by checking if `idx` is less than the length of the array. If it is, we can simply return the element at that index. Otherwise, we can raise an error.\n\nHere's the completed code:\n\n```python\narray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nidx = -1\nif idx < len(array):\n    answer = array[idx]\nelse:\n    raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\nassert answer == \"apple\"\n```\n\nThis code checks if `idx` is less than the length of `array`, and if so, it returns the element at that index. If `idx` is not less than the length of `array`, it raises an `IndexError` with a custom message. So the answer is  \"apple\". \n\n",

Determine the value at index 3: Since the array has 4 elements and we're starting from index 0, we need to subtract 1 from 3 to get the correct index. So, index 3 is actually at index 1 (0 = 3 - 3 = 0, 1 = 3 - 2 = 1, 2 = 3 - 1 = 2, 3 = 3 - 0 = 3).\n\n3.

We start by initializing the `array` with the given values.\n2. We set `idx` to 3, which is out of range for the array. In a 4x4 array, the valid indices are 0 to 3.\n3. We try to access the element at index `idx = 3`, which is out of range.\n4. In Python, when you try to access an index that's out of range, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that `idx` is within the valid range before accessing the element. We can do this by using the `index` method of the list, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the value is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\narray = [[1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]]\nidx = 3\nanswer = array[idx]\ntry:\n    answer = array[index]\nexcept IndexError:\n    answer = \"Invalid index\"\nprint(answer)  # Output: Invalid index\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `index()` method to simplify the code:\n\n```python\narray = [[1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]]\nidx = 3\nanswer = array[index]\nprint(answer)  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn this case, the `index()` method returns `3`, which is the index of the element at `idx = 3`.
