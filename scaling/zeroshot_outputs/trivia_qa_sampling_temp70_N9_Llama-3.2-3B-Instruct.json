It was repealed in 1933 with the 21st Amendment.\n\n2. **Understand the timeline of state repeals**: After the 21st Amendment was ratified, individual states were free to choose whether to allow or prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol. The process of repealing state-level Prohibition laws began shortly after the federal ban was lifted.\n\n3. **Identify the last state to reintroduce alcohol**: To determine the last state to reintroduce alcohol, we need to look at the timeline of when each state repealed its Prohibition laws. The order of repeal varied among states, but some states repealed their laws relatively quickly, while others took more time.\n\n4. **Research the last state to reintroduce alcohol**: After reviewing the history, it appears that **Mississippi** was the last state to officially repeal its Prohibition laws, doing so on July 1, 1989. This was nearly six decades after the federal ban was repealed.\n\nSo, the answer is: Mississippi was the last US state to reintroduce alcohol after Prohibition. So the answer is 1989.",

The next innovation in record technology was the gramophone, which was invented by Emile Berliner in the late 1880s.\n5. The gramophone records were made of shellac, a hard, brittle material.\n6. The development of vinyl records began in the 1940s, with the introduction of vinylite, a more flexible and durable material.\n7. The first vinyl records were introduced in the 1940s, but they were not commercially available for public sale until the 1950s.\n\nSo, based on these steps, I can conclude that stereo records first went on sale in the 1950s.

In the early 1940s, several companies, including RCA Victor and Columbia Records, began experimenting with stereo recording and playback technology.\n3. However, the first commercial stereo records were not released until the mid-1950s.\n4. The first commercial stereo records were released in 1958, with RCA Victor's \"God Bless America\" album being one of the first commercially available stereo records.\n5. The 1950s saw a gradual introduction of stereo records to the market, with more and more labels and manufacturers releasing stereo versions of popular music.\n\nSo, to answer your question, stereo records first went on sale in the 1950s.

These early records were called gramophone records and were played at a single speed (78 rpm).\n2. **Introduction of 78 rpm records**: The first 78 rpm records were introduced in the late 1880s and early 1890s. These records were the first commercial records, and they were widely popular during the early 20th century.\n3. **Introduction of electrical recording**: In the 1920s, electrical recording technology became available, allowing for the creation of higher-quality recordings. This led to the development of longer-playing records.\n4. **Introduction of 33 1/3 rpm records**: In the 1940s, the first long-playing (LP) records were introduced, which played at 33 1/3 rpm. These records were a significant improvement over 78 rpm records and became widely popular.\n5. **Introduction of stereo records**: The first stereo records were introduced in the late 1950s. These records used two channels of audio, one for the left speaker and one for the right speaker, to create a more immersive listening experience.\n\nConsidering these steps, I can conclude that stereo records first went on sale in the **1950s**, specifically in the late 1950s.

The first stereo long-playing (LP) records were introduced in the late 1950s, with the first one being released in 1958.\n\nSo, to answer your question, stereo records first went on sale in the 1950s. So the answer is 1950s.",

The plot was discovered by the Nazis and led to the arrest and execution of many of the conspirators.\n\nThe target of the plot was Adolf Hitler, who was the F\u00fchrer of Nazi Germany at the time.

One notable event that occurred in 1944 is the D-Day invasion of Normandy, also known as Operation Overlord.\n3. Consider the nature of the event: The question mentions a \"Bomb Plot,\" which implies a plot to harm or attack someone or something.\n4. Look for notable plots or conspiracies from 1944: One notable plot that comes to mind is the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944.\n\nBased on these steps, I believe the target of the failed \"Bomb Plot\" of 1944 was Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany.\n\nIs that correct?

And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, that I will bring the shadow of the land of Egypt, and it shall reach even to Nineveh, and I will spread out My hand over it, and cut off from it those who will plunder the foot of it.'\"\n\nIn 2 Chronicles 32:32, it is written: \"Now, behold, the days of Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, when he was dead, he was one hundred and fifty years old, and he was buried. And lo, they did seek to bury him, but they could not find his body. They came from Samaria, and from the cities of the hill country to the brook Kiriath Jearim: and they carried him over, and laid him in his own city, and he was buried. And Hezekiah was a good and God-fearing man, and all Israel loved him.\"\n\nHowever, in Joshua 10:12-14, it is written: \"Now it came to pass, when Joshua was old, and very old, that the Lord said to him, 'You are now old and very old, and there is more work for you to do.' And Joshua said, 'As for me, when the Lord is great, I will arise and go to you.' And Joshua fell on his face to the ground in the presence of Eleazar the high priest, and all the elders of Israel, and they rose up all of them and said to Joshua, 'No, no; you will not go with us; for you are one of the elders of the congregation, and will enquire of God, but we will not go with you.' But they urged Joshua to turn back, and he said to them, 'No; I will do all that I have been commanded by the Lord, which I will do. So I went up from there to the land of the Philistines, and all Israel with me. And when we came to the border of Bethel, the Spirit of the Lord was present over us, and they came to Bethel, and to the grove of Baal-peor, and to the spring of Ephron, and the people sat down there to worship. And the Spirit of God came upon the priests, and they stood up, and each one of them turned his face to the shekinah of the Lord, and the priests blew with trumpets, and the Lord raised up a whirlwind, and it was like a great and mighty sound, and the wall between the two armies came down, so that the battle was turned from the Israelites. And the sun and the moon stood still for about two hours, and the day was divided, and it was as if the day of the Lord had come. And it came to pass that Joshua and all Israel took up their armor and smote the army of the Amorites, and Joshua struck them with a great slaughter. So the land was subdued that day, for the sun stood still, and the moon stood still, and the hand of the Lord was upon the sea.'\"\n\nSo, to answer your question, the sun and moon stood still before Joshua, as part of a miraculous event where God intervened to give the Israelites a victory over their enemies. So the answer is  Joshua.",

He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime.\n4. **Last inmate**: After Speer's release from prison in 1966, the prison was closed and used for various purposes, including as a museum and a conference center.\n5. **Current status**: The Spandau Prison is now a museum and a memorial to the victims of the Nazi regime. It is no longer used as a prison.\n\nTherefore, the last inmate of Spandau Prison was Albert Speer, who was released in 1966. So the answer is  Albert Speer.",

He was sentenced to life imprisonment and served his sentence at Spandau Prison from 1947 until his death on August 17, 1987.\n\nSpandau Prison was a special prison built for Hess, who was deemed too important to be held in a regular prison. It was located in the Berlin suburb of Spandau, and was designed to be a maximum-security facility with a special wing for high-ranking officials.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Rudolf Hess was the last inmate of Spandau Prison in Berlin. So the answer is 1987.",

The prison was closed in 1966.\n\nThe last person to be imprisoned in Spandau Prison was actually a man named Alfred Naujocks, who was a German SS officer and a close associate of Rudolf Hess. He was arrested in 1959 and held in the prison until his death in 1985.\n\nSo, to clarify, the last inmate of Spandau Prison in Berlin was likely Alfred Naujocks, not Rudolf Hess.

To transition to film, he started making appearances on stage and screen in the 1940s, with some early roles in films like \"The Big Clock\" (1948) and \"The Naked City\" (1948).\n4. Matthau's breakthrough film role came with the 1954 film \"Strangers When We Meet,\" which was a drama directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\n5. However, it's worth noting that \"Strangers When We Meet\" is often considered one of his early film roles, but not his very first movie appearance.\n\nAfter some research, I found that Walter Matthau's first film appearance was actually in the 1947 film \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" directed by William Wyler. So the answer is 1947's \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\"",

However, he was not as prominent in mythology as his brothers Brontes and Steropes.\n2. **Brontes** (also known as Brontes or Brontios): He was the most famous of the three brothers. His name is derived from the Greek word \"brontes,\" which means \"thunder.\" According to myth, Brontes was said to have been the first Cyclops to be killed by the hero Odysseus and his men during their journey on the island of Aeaea. His death was a significant event in the story of the Odyssey.\n3. **Steropes** (also known as Sterops or Steropios): He was the third of the three brothers. His name is derived from the Greek word \"sterops,\" which means \"rock\" or \"stone.\" Steropes was said to be the only Cyclops who was not killed by Odysseus and his men. He was known for his cunning and intelligence.\n\nAll three brothers were known for their exceptional strength, but their stories are relatively minor compared to those of other figures in Greek mythology.

Arges made the lightning bolts for Zeus, Brontes made the bolts for Poseidon, and Steropes made the bolts for Hades, the god of the underworld.\n\nThe name \"Cyclops\" comes from the Greek word \"k\u00faklos\" (\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"circle\", which refers to the three of them having only one eye, as they were born without eyes (or with only one eye each).\n\nThese three brothers played an important role in Greek mythology, particularly in the stories surrounding the Olympian gods.

According to some accounts, Brontes was the one who forged the lightning bolts for Zeus, the King of the Gods.\n3. **Steropes** (meaning \"Storm\"): Steropes was another son of Uranus and Gaea, and like his brothers, he was also known for his incredible strength. He was said to be a skilled craftsman and was often associated with the forge.\n\nAll three Cyclopes were said to be incredibly strong and skilled in craftsmanship, and were often depicted as powerful and fearsome giants.

So the answer is 3 Cyclopes: Arges, Brontes, and Steropes!",
