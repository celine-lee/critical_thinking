The last element of the list is at index -1, the second last element is at index -2, and so on.\n\nGiven the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the elements are:\n\n- `array[0] = 1`\n- `array[1] = 2`\n- `array[2] = 3`\n- `array[3] = 4`\n- `array[4] = 5`\n- `array[-1] = 5` (last element)\n- `array[-2] = 4` (second last element)\n- `array[-3] = 3` (third last element)\n- `array[-4] = 2` (fourth last element)\n- `array[-5] = 1` (first element)\n\nSince `idx` is set to `-2`, we are accessing the second last element of the array, which is `4`.\n\nTherefore, the expected output of the assert statement is `4`.\n\nHere's the completed assert statement:\n\n```\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nidx = -2\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == 4\n``` So the answer is 4.",
