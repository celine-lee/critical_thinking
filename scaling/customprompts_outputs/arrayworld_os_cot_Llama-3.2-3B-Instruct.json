This means that `idx` is the remainder when `idx` is divided by the length of the array.\n4.  `idx` is subtracted from the length of the array. This means that `idx` is decreased by the length of the array.\n5.  `idx` is decreased by `7`. This means that `idx` is decreased by `7`.\n\nNow, we determine the value of `idx` by working backwards through the operations:\n\n1.  `idx` is decreased by `7`. This means that `idx` is `len(array) - 7`.\n2.  `idx` is the remainder when `len(array) - 7` is divided by `len(array)`. This means that `idx` is `len(array) - 7 mod len(array)`, which is equivalent to `len(array) - 7`.\n3.  `idx` is decreased by the length of the array. This means that `idx` is `len(array) - 7 - len(array)`, which is equivalent to `-7`.\n4.  `-7` modulo `len(array)` is equivalent to `len(array) - 7`. This is because the modulo operation returns a value in the range `0 <= x < len(array)`.\n5.  `idx` is doubled. This means that `idx` is `2 * (len(array) - 7)`.\n6.  `idx` is decreased by `5`. This means that `idx` is `2 * (len(array) - 7) - 5`.\n\nWe can simplify this expression by distributing the `2`:\n\n`2 * (len(array) - 7) - 5`\n\n`2 * len(array) - 14 - 5`\n\n`2 * len(array) - 19`\n\nNow we determine the value of `idx` by working backwards through the operations:\n\n1.  `idx` is the `19`th element of the array.

To determine the value of `answer` at the end of the code snippet, we need to follow the value of `idx` as it is modified in each step.\n\nInitially, `idx` is `4`. The first assignment `idx = idx + 1` increases `idx` by `1` to `5`. The second assignment `idx = idx + 1` increases `idx` by `1` to `6`. The third assignment `idx = idx + 2` increases `idx` by `2` to `8`. The fourth assignment `idx = idx - 2` decreases `idx` by `2` to `6`. The fifth assignment `idx = idx - 2` decreases `idx` by `2` to `4`. The sixth assignment `idx = idx - 1` decreases `idx` by `1` to `3`. The seventh assignment `idx = idx + 13` increases `idx` by `13` to `16`. The eighth assignment `idx = array[idx]` assigns the element at `idx` to `idx`, which is the element at `16` in the array.\n\nTherefore, the output set to `answer` is 19.\n\n[ANSWER]assert answer == 19[/ANSWER]\n\n",
