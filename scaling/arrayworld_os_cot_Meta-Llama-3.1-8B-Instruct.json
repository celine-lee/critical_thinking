So the value of `idx` before this line is `(len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5`.\n\nThe sixth to last line of the code is `idx = idx * 2`. So the value of `idx` before this line is `2 * ((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5)`.\n\nThe seventh to last line of the code is `idx = 5`. So the value of `idx` before this line is `2 * ((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5) / 5`.\n\nSince the value of `idx` before the line `idx = 5` is `2 * ((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5) / 5` and `idx = 5`, then `2 * ((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5) / 5 = 5`.\n\nTo solve for `idx`, we need to solve the equation `2 * ((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5) / 5 = 5`. \n\nFirst, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get `2 * ((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5) = 25`.\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 2 to get `((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) + 5) = 12.5`.\n\nNext, we can subtract 5 from both sides to get `((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array)) = 7.5`.\n\nNext, we can subtract `len(array)` from both sides to get `((len(array) - (idx + 9)) % len(array) - len(array)) = 7.5 - len(array)`.\n\nNext, we can add `idx + 9` to both sides to get `((len(array) - (idx + 9)) - (idx + 9)) = 7.5 - len(array)`.\n\nNext, we can simplify the left side to get `len(array) - 2 * (idx + 9) = 7.5 - len(array)`.\n\nNext, we can add `2 * (idx + 9)` to both sides to get `len(array) = 2 * (idx + 9) + 7.5 - len(array)`.\n\nNext, we can add `len(array)` to both sides to get `2 * len(array) = 2 * (idx + 9) + 7.5`.\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 2 to get `len(array) = (idx + 9) + 3.75`.\n\nNext, we can subtract `3.75` from both sides to get `len(array) - 3.75 = idx + 9`.\n\nNext, we can subtract 9 from both sides to get `len(array) - 3.75 - 9 = idx`.\n\nSince `len(array) - 3.75 - 9` is equal to `idx` and `idx` is used to index into `array`, then `array[idx]` is equal to `array[len(array) - 3.75 - 9]`.\n\nSince `array` is a list of integers and `len(array) - 3.75 - 9` is not an integer, then `array[len(array) - 3.75 - 9]` is equal to `array[len(array) - 12.75]`.\n\nSince `len(array) - 12.75` is not an integer, then `array[len(array) - ",

This can be seen as equivalent to `idx = 2 * idx - 5`. Then it takes the modulus of `idx` with the length of `array`, which is equivalent to `idx = idx % len(array)`. \n\nThen it subtracts `idx` from the length of `array`, which is equivalent to `idx = len(array) - idx`. Then it subtracts 4 from `idx`, which is equivalent to `idx = idx - 4`.\n\nNow we have to find the value of `idx` after these operations.\n\nLet's denote the initial value of `idx` as `x`. Then `idx = 2x - 5`. Taking the modulus of `idx` with the length of `array` is equivalent to taking the modulus of `2x - 5` with the length of `array`. This is equivalent to `idx = (2x - 5) % len(array)`. \n\nThen `idx = len(array) - (2x - 5) % len(array)`.

This simplifies to `idx = len(array) - 2x + 1`. \n\nTherefore, `idx` is equivalent to `len(array) - 2x + 1`.\n\nNow we can determine the value of `idx` by substituting `x = 5` into `idx = len(array) - 2x + 1`.

We know that the final value of `idx` is 11. The question is how we get there from 19.\n\nWe start with `idx = 19`. Then, we subtract 20 from `idx`, which results in `idx = -1`. Then we add 1 to `idx`, which results in `idx = 0`. Then, we subtract 1 from `idx`, which results in `idx = -1`. Then, we subtract 2 from `idx`, which results in `idx = -3`. Then, we subtract 1 from `idx`, which results in `idx = -4`. Finally, we add 14 to `idx`, which results in `idx = 10`. However, we need to get `idx = 11`. We can do that by adding 1 to `idx`. Therefore, the final value of `idx` is 11.\n\n[ANSWER]assert array[11] == 12[/ANSWER]\n\n",

Therefore, before this operation, `idx` was `idx + 20`.\n- `idx` is set to `idx - 1` before the tenth-to-last operation.

Therefore, before the ninth-to-last operation, `idx` was `idx + 1`. We know that `idx` is set to `idx + 20` before the ninth-to-last operation.

Therefore, the operation from the ninth-to-last operation to the eighth-to-last operation did not change the value of `idx`. We can ignore this operation and go back to the seventh-to-last operation.\n\nWe know that `idx` was `idx - 20` before the seventh-to-last operation. Therefore, before the seventh-to-last operation, `idx` was `idx - 20 + 21`. This is equal to `idx + 1`.\n\nNow we know that `idx` was `idx + 1` before the seventh-to-last operation, and we know that `idx` was `idx + 1` before the sixth-to-last operation. Therefore, the operation from the seventh-to-last operation to the sixth-to-last operation did not change the value of `idx`. We can ignore this operation and go back to the fifth-to-last operation.\n\nWe know that `idx` was `idx + 1` before the fifth-to-last operation. Therefore, before the fifth-to-last operation, `idx` was `idx + 1 - 2`. This is equal to `idx - 1`.\n\nNow we know that `idx` was `idx - 1` before the fifth-to-last operation, and we know that `idx` was `idx - 1` before the fourth-to-last operation.

We can ignore this operation and go back to the third-to-last operation.\n\nWe know that `idx` was `idx - 1` before the third-to-last operation. Therefore, before the third-to-last operation, `idx` was `idx - 1 + 1`.
