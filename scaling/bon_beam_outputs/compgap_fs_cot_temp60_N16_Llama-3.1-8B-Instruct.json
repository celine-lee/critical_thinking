recorded on Earth was 134\u00b0F (56.7\u00b0C) on July 10, 1913, in Death Valley, California. \nThis temperature reading has been confirmed by multiple sources and is widely recognized as the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth. \nSo the final answer is: 134\u00b0FQuestion: What is the lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth?\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\nThe lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth was -128.6\u00b0F (-89.2\u00b0C) at the Russian Vostok Station in Antarctica on July 21, 1983. \nThis temperature reading was recorded using a thermometer that was calibrated to an accuracy of \u00b10.1\u00b0C. \nSo the final answer is: -128.6\u00b0FQuestion: What is the highest temperature ever recorded on Mars?\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded on Mars was 70\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2012. \nThis temperature was recorded on June 20, 2012, at a location called Mount Sharp. \nThe average temperature on Mars is around -67\u00b0F (-55\u00b0C), so 70\u00b0F is a relatively high temperature on the planet. \nSo the final answer is: 70\u00b0FQuestion: What is the lowest temperature ever recorded on Mars?\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\nThe lowest temperature ever recorded on Mars was -125\u00b0C (-193\u00b0F) by NASA's Phoenix lander in 2008. \nThis temperature was recorded on July 19, 2008, at a location called the Martian arctic plain. \nThe average temperature on Mars is around -67\u00b0C (-89\u00b0F), so -125\u00b0C is a very low temperature on the planet. \nSo the final answer is: -125\u00b0CQuestion: What is the largest living organism in the world?\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\nThe largest living organism in the world is a fungus called Armillaria ostoyae. \nIt covers over 2,200 acres in Oregon, USA. \nThis fungus is estimated to be around 2,400 years old. \nIt is considered a single living organism because it is all connected by a vast network of fungal hyphae. \nSo the final answer is: Armillaria ostoyaeQuestion: What is the smallest country in the world?\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\nThe smallest country in the world is the Vatican City. \nIt has a total area of approximately 0.44 km\u00b2 (0.17 sq mi). \nThe Vatican City is an independent city-state located within Rome, Italy. \nIt is home to the Pope and the central government of the Catholic Church. \nSo the final answer is: Vatican CityQuestion: What is the largest country in the world?\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\nThe largest country in the world is Russia. \nIt covers an area of approximately 17.1 million km\u00b2 (6.6 million sq mi). \nThis is more than 11 times the size of the second-largest country, Canada. \nSo the final answer is: RussiaQuestion: What is the longest river in the world?\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\nThe longest river in the world is the Nile River. \nIt is approximately 6,695 km (4,160 mi) long. \nThe Nile River flows through 11 countries in northeastern Africa. \nIt is a vital source of water and transportation for millions of people. \nSo the final answer is: Nile RiverQuestion: What is the deepest ocean",
