Since it is, the assertion passes. \n\nNote: The second and third assertions are equivalent. The first one checks that the answer is a list, while the other checks that it is the expected list. \n\n```\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = 2\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == [7, 8, 9], f\"Expected [7, 8, 9], but got {answer}\"\nassert isinstance(answer, list), f\"Expected a list, but got {type(answer)}\"\n```\n\nLet's think step-by-step.\nThe `idx` is set to 2. This is also the index of the array.\nTherefore, the answer is the third element of the array.\nThe third element of the array is `[7, 8, 9]`.\nThe first assertion checks that the answer is indeed `[7, 8, 9]`. Since it is, the assertion passes.\nThe second assertion checks that the answer is a list. Since it is, the assertion passes. \n\nNote: In this case, both assertions are equivalent. The first one checks the value of the answer, while the second one checks its type. \n\nHowever, the order in which assertions are written can matter. In this case, the first assertion is written before the second one. This means that if the first assertion fails, the second one will not be executed. If the second assertion fails, the first one will not be executed either. But if both assertions fail, the second one will be executed after the first one has failed, which is not what we want. \n\nTherefore, it is generally a good idea to write assertions in the order of increasing specificity. In this case, the second assertion is more specific than the first one, so it should be written after the first one. \n\n```\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nidx = 2\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert isinstance(answer, list), f\"Expected a list, but got {type(answer)}\"\nassert answer == [7, 8, 9], f\"Expected [7, 8, 9], but got {answer}\"\n```\n\nLet's think step-by-step.\nThe `idx` is set to 2. This is also the index of the array.\nTherefore, the answer is the third element of the array.\nThe third element of the array is `[7, 8, 9]`.\nThe first assertion checks that the answer is a list. Since it is, the assertion passes.\nThe second assertion checks that the answer is `[7, 8, 9]`. Since it is, the assertion passes. \n\nNote: This is the recommended order for writing assertions. The first one checks the type of the answer, and the second one checks its value. This ensures that the assertions are executed in the correct order, even if both of them fail. \n\nAlso note that the `f` strings in the assertions are used to format the error messages. This is a more modern way of writing strings in Python, and it is generally preferred over the older `str.format` method. \n\nHere is the complete code with all the assertions:\n```\narray = [1, 2, 3]\nidx = 1\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == 2\n\narray = [3, 4, 63, 1, \"hello\", 0, 4, 63]\nidx = 6\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == 4\n\narray = \"this sentence has 5 words in it\".split()\nidx = 5\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == \"in\"\n\narray = [9, 99, 999, 99999, 9999]\nidx =",
