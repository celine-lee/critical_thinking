Since Python is zero-indexed, the answer is the second element of `array`.\nTherefore, the output set to `answer` is 2.\n[ANSWER]assert answer == 2[/ANSWER]\n\n```\narray = [3, 4, 63, 1, \"hello\", 0, 4, 63]\nidx = 6\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == ??\n```\n\nLet's think step-by-step.\nThe `6` index of the array is `4`.\n[ANSWER]assert answer == 4[/ANSWER]\n\n```\narray = \"this sentence has 5 words in it\".split()\nidx = 5\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == ??\n```\n\nLet's think step-by-step.\nThe `array` variable is the list of words in the sentence: `[\"this\", \"sentence\", \"has\", \"5\", \"words\", \"in\", \"it\"]`.\n`idx` is set to 5. \nLet's count out the indices and their corresponding array elements:\n0: \"this\"\n1: \"sentence\"\n2: \"has\"\n3: \"5\"\n4: \"words\"\n5: \"in\"\n[ANSWER]assert answer == \"in\"[/ANSWER]\n\n```\narray = [9, 99, 999, 99999, 9999]\nidx = -1\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == ??\n```\n\nLet's think step-by-step.\nThe `-1` index of an array in Python is the last element.\nSo the answer is 9999.\n[ANSWER]assert answer == 9999[/ANSWER]\n\n```\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nidx = -2\nanswer = array[idx]\nassert answer == ??\n```\n\nLet's think step-by-step.\n",
